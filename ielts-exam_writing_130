which is about the things which make them happy. As can be seen, in both of scenarios doing hobbies and achievement at work are 
most important two factors which motivate people as having more than 50 percent of all factors. On the other hand, while 
having a good appearance and travelling had a important ratio for the people under 30, they have no effect on the people 
above 30 and besides being with family and financial security appeared as being two important elements above the years 30. 

As is presented in the pie charts achievement at work is the most efficient thing which mostly effects the people in both groups.
it has nearly one-third in two conditions, too. Other factors decreased gradually from 14% to 10%, whereas doing hobbies increased 
slightly and achieved 24% for the people above 30.
