Overall, the education level of the people who live in Singapore is better than the education level of the people 
who live in Malaysia but it's clearly seen that the education level is a problem for both 
Asian countries which are given in the graph.

As is presented in the bar graph, while the least percentage, with about 2%, is the percentage of the people who are classified
as having Master's degree in Malaysia and Singapore is equal, when it comes to comparing the percentages of the persons who
have Bachelor's degree, the percentage of Singaporean(20%) is much higher than the percentage of Malaysian(10%). 

It's noticeable that the percentage of the people's science qualification below bachelor degree is higher than the Malaysian 
who are in same science qualification group. Especially the proportion of the people who aren't qualified in a science group
increase enormously with 60 percent for Singaporean and around 65 percent for Malaysian.
