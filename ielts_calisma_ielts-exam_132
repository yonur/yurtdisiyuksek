The provided line graph outlines the comparison of two variable which increased pollution level in London from 1580s to 2000s.
As is presented in the graph pollution value of Sulphur dioxide in the atmosfer is same the pollution level of smoke at 
the beginning and ending of the time period which is given in the graph. On the other hand this situation is not same 
during all period. In different parts of the graph, the pollution level of sulphur dioxide had increased and decreased 
much faster than the pollution level of the smoke. 

As can be seen in the line graph while both of two factors are in the same level as being about 0 in the 1580, the pollution level
of sulphur dioxide had increased to about 700 micrograms per cubic metre and the pollution level of smoke had increased 
to about 100 micrograms per cubic metre in 1680. Following this the pollution level of two variets show no overall pattern of rise 
or fall rather shows the considerable fluctuation until 1780. From that point both of two pollution ingredients generally continue
to rise even though there was rapid changes till about 1900. From that point, rapid decreases started. As an overall trend polution 
levels which occured due to smoke and sulphur dioxide fell sharply with some flucutations until the end of the time period of line 
graph.

The graph shows pollution levels in London between 1600 and 2000. It measures smoke and sulphur dioxide in micrograms per cubic
metre. According to the information, the levels of both pollutants formed a similar pattern during this period, but there were 
always higher levels of sulphur dioxide than smoke in the atmosphere. 

In 1600, pollution levels were low, but over the next hundred years, the levels of sulphur dioxide rose to 700 micrograms per cubic
metre, while the levels of smoke rose gradually to about 200 micrograms per cubic metre. Over the next two hundred years the level 
of sulphur dioxide continued to increase, although there was some fluctuation in this trend. They reached a peak in 1850. Smoke 
levels increased a little more sharply during this time and peaked in 1900 at about 500 micrograms. During the 20th century, 
the levels of both pollutants fell dramatically, though there was a great deal of fluctuation within this fall. 

Clearly air pollution was a bigger problem in London in the early 20th century than it is now.
