The given graphs give information on renews that have been come true at Queen May Hospital from the date that it was built to 2000.
Overall, the land which belongs to main hospital area remained same during all time period but shopping center's land wasn't needed
in the following years. On the other hand,  it was given significantly more importance to the Cancer Center and also it was given 
places to the other places such as Nursing School and Pharmacy. 

As is presented in the diagrams, the land which was presented to be used by shopping center was given to Cancer Center and Pharmacy 
in 1960. The land which was belonged to farmland in 1960 also was started to use by Nursing school in 1980. Besides, it can be seen 
that in 2000 the Nursing School's land was used by the Cancer Center and Nursing School was moved to half of the land of the car 
park.

The diagrams show Queen May Hospital at three different stages in its development: 1960, 1980 and 2000. 

In 1960, the hospital was built close to a main road and next to a shopping centre. A large area behind the hospital turned into
a car park, while the area behind the shopping centre was farmland.

By 1980, the shopping centre had been demolished in order to make way for two additional hospital building which became a pharmacy 
and a cancer center. Furthermore, the hospital gained the farmland and converted it into a nursing school. 

In 2000, the main hospital building remained unchanged but the cancer centre was extended to cover the entire nursing school. As a 
result of this, the original car park was divided into two so that it provided a small nursing school.

During this period, the hospital has inreased in size and, in addition to a new nursing school, a cancer centre has been created 
and extended. Hence the capacity of the car park has been reduced by a half.
