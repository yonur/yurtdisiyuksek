The pie charts show the proportion of money spent on various household expenses in Malaysia and in Japan in 2010.

We can see that in Malaysia the greatest proportion of expenditure (34%) was on housing, while in Japan housing accounted for 
just 21% of the total. In contrast, in Japan the greatest single expense was other goods and services at 29%, compared with 26% 
in Malaysia. Food came in second place in Japan, at 24%, while in Malaysia the actual proportion was higher(27%). In Japan 
another major expense was transport, at 20%, but this was much lower in Malaysia(10%). In both countries the smallest percentage
of expenditure was on health care.

Overall, the data indicates that in both cases food, housing and other goods and services were the main expenses, but that in 
Japan, transport and other goods and services took up a higher proportion of total expenditure than in Malaysia.
