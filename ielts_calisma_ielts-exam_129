On the other hand least exported product which meat product was around 4 billion dollars. Following this in 2015 total cost of main
export products of someland moderately increased whereas dairy product increased so sharply that is about 8 billion dollars
in 2015. On the other hand it's predicted that the highest export main product of someland will be again International tourism as

product, will be bout 3 bilion USD dollars. Export of dairy product will steadily decrease and its value will be a little more than
