The presented bar graph illustrates the export values in USD billion dollars among the main exports of Someland in 2005, 2015
and in 2025./ The presented bar graph illustrates the three main export products which were produced in 2005, 2015 and also 
the possible producting values will be produced in 2025./ As can be seen in the graph the most exported product were changed 
among the years in the graph but the least exported product is meat product during all time period of the graph.

As is presented in the bar chart most exported product was International tourism in 2005 as having just over 6 billion USD dollars.
In the same year least exported product which meat product was around 4 billion dollars. Following this while internation tourism
slightly increased between 2005 and 2015, dairy product increased so sharply that is about 8 billion USD dollars.
On the other hand meat products' export value changing showed a different pattern from other two export products at the same
time period, with fall around half billion dollars. Estimates for the year 2025 that the least exported product,
meat product, will be bout 3 bilion USD dollars and export of dairy product will steadily decrease and its value will be
a little more than 7.5 billion dollars. It's interesting to note that international toursim will have again highest value with a
gradual increase.
