  
  The provided line graph illustrates inhabitants of the people who living in India and China from 2000 to nowadays 
  and anticipated inhabitants rise until 2050. As can be seen that indian populace's rise is sharper than China inhabitants' rise. 
  Also rise of China inhabitants isn't persistent like Indian inhabitants' rise. Also China inhabitants' rise isn't continuous like 
  India inhabitants' rise during all time period of the graph. 
  
  As is presented in the diagram India inhabitants is 1 billion and China inhabitants is 250 million more than India inhabitants.
  From that point while India inhabitants increased sharply, China inhabitants climbed gradually. It's foreseen that rise
  is going to continue until 2030. Besides it's apparently observed that China inhbitants and India inhabitants are at same level 
  as being 1.45 billion in this year. Following this there will be a downturn for China population. India population's increase
  will be slower than the increasing before the year 2030.
  
  Finally it's estimated that in 2050 both countries population will be more than the their population in 2000 but China 
  population's upward trend won't continue during all time period like India population's upward trend and 
  India population as being 1.6 billion will be more than China population which is about 1.4 billion in 2050.
