The two tabels contain sales data for Fairtrade tea and pineapples in 2010 and 2015, in five nations of Europe.

The first table shows low-level tea sales increasing in all five countries, albeit to widely varied degrees. In two 
places sales increased by the same small amount 2.8-3 million euros in Germany, and 1.8-2 million in Norway. The increment was
slightly larger in Netherlands, from 2-2.7 million euros. Meanwhile, in Austria sales doubled from 4-8 million euros. Finally, in
France there was an enormous increase, from 2.5-21 million euros. 

In the second table, it is Austria which stands out as buying far more Fairtrade pineapples than the other four countries. 
The sales figures for Austria jumped from 16-48 million euros across these five years, while in France and Netherlands sales only
grew from 2-6.5 and from 1.6-5 million euros respectively. Norway and Germany showed a different pattern, with falls in pineapple
sales from 2.8-2 and 3-1.9 million euros.

Comparing the two tables, it is clear that in 2010 Fairtrade tea sales ranged from 1.8-4 million euros with these five countries,
while pineapple sales also mostly clustered between 1.6 and 3 million euros, with Austria the outlier at a huge 16 million euros.
By 2015, sales figures for both products had risen across the board, except for Norway and Germany which recorded drops in pineapple
sales.
