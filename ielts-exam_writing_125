The grap illustrates counts of the students in the UK who are qualificated as an English language teacher in 2007/8 and 2008/9,
and the percentage of male qualifiers. Overall, there is a slight increase the total number of the students from 2007/8 to 2008/9.
On the other hand the counts of the students who are qualificated as an English teacher by TEFL decreased.

As is illustrated in the graph, percentage of male students decreased for all certificate progam in the list, whereas the students
are qualificated by TEFL slightly decreased. It's interesting to note that while the numbers of the students are qualificated 
by Cambridge UCLES CELTA & other degrees slowly increased, percentage of male students considerably decreased from 17.3% to 12.1%. 
Additionally, decreasing number of male students for all certificate system in 2008/9 is evidence that the number of the female 
students were noticeably increased during this period. And it's clearly seen that the number of the female student passed the number
of the male student who are qualificated as an English teacher.

This report summarises information on the total number of students in the United Kingdom who  gained qualifications for English 
Language Teachers in two academic years, 2007/8 and 2008/9, with specific focus on the number of male qualfiers.

In both years, the total numbers of students remained the same, but there was a great difference between numbers of male and female
students who qualified. In 2008, out of a total of 32,930 students, only 24.7% were male. The percentage of males who qualified in
2008/9 was even lower. Out of a total of 32,945 students, only 22.7% of them were male. This is a drop of 2%.

There was also a large difference in the qualification that students studied for. Most students qualified with a TEFL certificate;
this was true for male students. The number of students who qualified with the TEFL was roughly three times the number who qualified
with a Cambridge UCLES CELTA or other degrees, although the total number of students qualifying with the TEFL dropped slightly, from
25,446 to 24,917 a year later. There was a drop of 0.7% in the number of male students who gained this qualification.

In general it can be seen that the number of males qualifying as English language teachers is vastly outnumbered by females and
that the proportion of male qualifiers is gradually dropping.
